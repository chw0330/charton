    steps:
      # Step 1: Clone the repository
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Install the Rust toolchain with required components
      - name: Set up Rust
        uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
        with:
          components: clippy, rustfmt

      # Step 3: Enable smart caching for Rust dependencies
      # This reuses compiled crates between runs, making CI 2-3x faster
      - name: Rust Cache
        uses: Swatinem/rust-cache@v2

      # Step 4: Verify that the code follows standard formatting
      - name: Check formatting
        run: cargo fmt --all -- --check

      # Step 5: Compile the project
      # Separating build and test helps pinpoint if a failure is in compilation or logic
      - name: Build
        run: cargo build --verbose

      # Step 6: Run all unit and integration tests
      - name: Run tests
        run: cargo test --verbose

      # Step 7: Run static analysis (Linter)
      - name: Lint with Clippy
        run: cargo clippy -- -D warnings
